# Enterprise Vulnerability Scanner Development Progress

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Create the ultimate enterprise-level vulnerability scanning tool for bug hunters in 2025
**Target**: 100% accuracy, minimal false positives, critical vulnerability detection including zero-days

## Core Features
1. **Web Application Security Testing**
   - XSS (Reflected, Stored, DOM-based)
   - SQL Injection (Union, Blind, Time-based)
   - CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
   - SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
   - Directory Traversal
   - Command Injection
   - Authentication Bypass
   - Authorization Flaws
   - File Upload Vulnerabilities

2. **Network/Infrastructure Scanning**
   - Port scanning and service detection
   - SSL/TLS vulnerabilities
   - Misconfigurations
   - Network protocol vulnerabilities
   - Cloud infrastructure assessment

3. **Static Code Analysis**
   - Security vulnerability detection in source code
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Secrets detection in code
   - Best practice violations

4. **GPT-4 Integration**
   - Intelligent vulnerability analysis
   - Custom payload generation
   - Detailed vulnerability explanations
   - Risk assessment and prioritization
   - Remediation recommendations

**GPT-4 API Status**: Connected via OpenRouter with limited free credits (≈600 tokens available)

## API Endpoints Planned
- `POST /api/scan/web` - Web application scanning
- `POST /api/scan/network` - Network infrastructure scanning  
- `POST /api/scan/code` - Static code analysis
- `GET /api/scan/{scan_id}/status` - Scan progress
- `GET /api/scan/{scan_id}/results` - Scan results
- `POST /api/analyze/vulnerability` - GPT-4 vulnerability analysis
- `POST /api/generate/payload` - GPT-4 payload generation

## Database Collections
- `scans` - Scan job records
- `vulnerabilities` - Detected vulnerabilities
- `gpt_analyses` - GPT-4 analysis results
- `scan_targets` - Target configurations
