   - SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)
   - Directory Traversal
   - Command Injection
   - Authentication Bypass
   - Authorization Flaws
   - File Upload Vulnerabilities

2. **Network/Infrastructure Scanning**
   - Port scanning and service detection
   - SSL/TLS vulnerabilities
   - Misconfigurations
   - Network protocol vulnerabilities
   - Cloud infrastructure assessment

3. **Static Code Analysis**
   - Security vulnerability detection in source code
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Secrets detection in code
   - Best practice violations

4. **GPT-4 Integration**
   - Intelligent vulnerability analysis
   - Custom payload generation
   - Detailed vulnerability explanations
   - Risk assessment and prioritization
   - Remediation recommendations
